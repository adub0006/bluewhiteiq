# Abstract

This report develops a comprehensive **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and **Fan Engagement** framework for the *North Melbourne Football Club (NMFC)* using integrated data from membership sales, e-commerce, and digital engagement systems.\
The objective is to quantify both historical and projected customer value, identify high- and mid-tier customer cohorts, and translate these insights into actionable retention and growth strategies.

We calculate **historical CLV** as cumulative paid membership revenue and **projected CLV** using a retention–discount formula that accounts for future earnings potential.\
The datasets are merged and deduplicated using email and name matching across systems, yielding a unified customer table that links membership tenure, purchasing behaviour, and engagement frequency.\
Customers are then ranked and segmented into percentile bands (Top 10%, 10–20%, … Below 50%) to visualise the revenue concentration and identify key value drivers.

Results show a pronounced Pareto effect, with the top 20% of customers contributing roughly 70% of total revenue.
Engagement frequency exhibits a strong positive association with CLV, revealing that high-engagement, low-CLV fans represent the most promising upsell targets.\
Cross-channel analysis highlights opportunities for merchandise promotion among loyal members and membership upgrades among merchandise-heavy buyers.\
Together, these findings support a more data-driven, personalised engagement strategy for NMFC, enabling targeted retention, cross-sell, and loyalty initiatives aligned with long-term revenue growth.

# Executive Summary

This report presents an integrated data-driven analysis of North Melbourne Football Club’s (NMFC) customer base to quantify and enhance fan lifetime value. By consolidating membership, e-commerce, and engagement records, the study models Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using a retention–discount framework. The analysis reveals that approximately 20% of members contribute over 80% of total revenue, confirming a strong Pareto effect. Engagement frequency and purchase recency emerge as significant predictors of high CLV. Managerial insights highlight the importance of targeted retention programs, reactivation of mid-tier fans, and cross-channel engagement incentives to improve total projected value. The findings offer a scalable blueprint for data-driven fan segmentation and long-term value optimisation across professional sports organisations.

# Background and Motivation

In the modern sports and entertainment industry, fan relationships are increasingly treated as long-term assets rather than one-off transactions.
Clubs compete not only on-field but also through their ability to understand, retain, and monetise loyal supporters across multiple channels.
The rapid adoption of digital platforms—online ticketing, e-commerce stores, social media, and gamified fan-engagement apps—has produced rich data that can quantify the *lifetime* value of every supporter.
Measuring this value provides a concrete basis for investment in marketing, communication, and membership programs.

For the **North Melbourne Football Club (NMFC)**, an AFL organisation with a strong membership culture, this transformation from transactional data to behavioural insight is strategically important.
While the club maintains detailed sales and membership records, information about digital engagement and cross-channel purchases has historically remained fragmented.
Without an integrated view, it is difficult to identify which members generate the most revenue, which segments respond to campaigns, or how online engagement translates into renewals and merchandise sales.
A unified analytical framework linking these dimensions can therefore enhance both revenue forecasting and fan-experience design.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is the central concept that enables such integration.
CLV estimates the net profit a customer contributes over their relationship with the organisation, combining purchasing history, expected retention, and margin assumptions.
It is a standard measure in customer analytics and relationship-marketing research, yet its application to professional sport—where emotional loyalty and community identity also drive behaviour—offers unique insight.
By extending CLV to include **fan-engagement metrics**, NMFC can evaluate not only who spends the most but also who interacts most deeply with the club’s brand.

The motivation for this study is therefore twofold.
First, to construct a reproducible, data-driven approach that consolidates membership, e-commerce, and engagement information into a single analytical model.
Second, to use that model to uncover actionable insights: which fan groups deliver sustained value, where retention risks exist, and how digital engagement can be leveraged to nurture mid-tier supporters into high-value advocates.
The outcome aims to support NMFC’s long-term strategic objective of *sustainable membership growth through personalised engagement*.

# Objectives and Significance

The primary objective of this report is to develop an integrated, data-driven framework that quantifies and interprets the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** of North Melbourne Football Club (NMFC) members and fans.
The analysis consolidates information from membership sales, online merchandise transactions, and digital engagement systems to provide a unified picture of supporter behaviour and value creation.
In doing so, the project links financial performance metrics with behavioural indicators of loyalty—offering a richer basis for strategic decision-making than revenue data alone.

## Project Objectives

The specific analytical objectives are to:

1.  **Compute historical and projected CLV** for all active customers using membership revenue, tenure, and a retention–discount model that estimates future value potential.\
2.  **Segment customers by value tier**, ranking them into percentile bands (Top 10%, 10–20%, … Below 50%) to visualise the concentration of revenue and reveal structural differences across the supporter base.\
3.  **Assess behavioural drivers of value**, exploring how engagement frequency, purchase recency, and tenure relate to both historical and projected CLV.\
4.  **Compare membership and e-commerce spending**, identifying opportunities for cross-sell and upsell initiatives that increase total customer yield.\
5.  **Translate findings into actionable recommendations** for marketing, loyalty design, and fan-experience strategy.

## Significance and Contribution

From a **business perspective**, this project equips NMFC with a replicable analytics tool that can guide investment in membership campaigns, merchandise promotions, and retention programs.
By quantifying the relative value of different fan cohorts, management can prioritise high-impact segments and allocate marketing budgets more efficiently.
The results also provide evidence for developing personalised engagement initiatives—reward programs, tailored content, or event invitations—aimed at strengthening emotional and financial loyalty.

From an **academic and methodological perspective**, the report demonstrates how traditional CLV modelling can be extended to incorporate non-financial engagement indicators within the context of professional sport.
The integration of transactional and behavioural data illustrates a practical application of customer analytics, segmentation, and predictive modelling principles taught in the Master of Business Analytics.
The framework emphasises transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability—key criteria for modern data-driven decision support.

Ultimately, the significance of this work lies in bridging the gap between **fan passion and financial performance**.
By connecting engagement metrics to measurable lifetime value, NMFC can shift from reactive marketing to proactive relationship management, building sustainable growth grounded in data evidence.

# Data and Sources

This project uses **four integrated datasets** maintained by the North Melbourne Football Club (NMFC) to model *Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)* and *Fan Engagement*.\
Each dataset captures a distinct dimension of customer interaction — from paid memberships to behavioural engagement — and is linked through deterministic identity matching.

## Data Description

| Dataset | Description | Time Coverage | Key Variables |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Customer Master** | Core reference table containing demographic and contact information for each registered fan. Serves as the linking backbone across all systems. | FY2023–FY2025 | `customer_id`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `gender`, `postcode`, `join_date`, `account_status` |
| **Membership & Sales** | Financial records of annual memberships purchased by each customer. Includes payment amounts, renewal history, and membership type. | FY2023–FY2025 | `order_id`, `paid_amount_exgst`, `member_total_years`, `complimentary_type`, `account_status` |
| **E-commerce (Merchandise)** | Online merchandise purchases from the BigCommerce platform. Aggregated to the customer level by email. | FY2023–FY2025 | `order_total_inctax`, `order_date`, `order_channel`, `product_category`, `payment_method` |
| **Fan Engagement** | Digital interaction data (email opens, app logins, website visits, content engagement) recorded via the NMFC digital engagement platform. | FY2023–FY5 | `fan_id`, `event_type`, `event_ts`, `channel`, `campaign_id` |

**Table 1. Summary of four datasets used in this analysis.**

## Integration and Identity Matching

All datasets were linked using a **unique customer key** constructed from standardised identifiers (`email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `customer_id`).\
Matching followed a **three-tier strategy**:

1.  **Exact match:** lowercased, trimmed email + name combination.\
2.  **Fallback:** email-only match (where name missing but verified unique).\
3.  **Validation:** manual audit of high-value duplicates and removal of test/internal records.

The final integrated dataset contains **≈35,000 unique customers**, covering both paid members and casual digital fans.

## Derived Variables

-   **Total Historical Revenue (CLV):** sum of all paid membership and merchandise transactions per customer (ex-GST).\
-   **Tenure:** number of active membership years.\
-   **Engagement Frequency:** total number of digital interactions (all channels).\
-   **Recency:** days since most recent engagement or purchase.\
-   **Segment Tags:** membership type (Premium, GA, Junior, etc.) and engagement quartile labels.

## Data Quality and Limitations

-   **Coverage Bias:** ≈12% of customers lack valid email and were excluded from the unified dataset.\
-   **Complimentary Records:** free memberships excluded from CLV but retained for engagement analysis.\
-   **Missing Values:** handled via median imputation for tenure, zero-filling for null revenue.\
-   **Temporal Granularity:** all dates rounded to monthly level for anonymity.\
-   **Data Governance:** access restricted to NMFC analytics sandbox under signed NDA.

# Methodology

This section outlines the methodological framework used to transform NMFC’s multi-source data into actionable insights about customer value and engagement.\
The approach integrates transactional and behavioural data, cleans and reconciles identities, and applies analytical models to quantify and segment Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

## Conceptual Framework

The methodology follows a **data-to-decision pipeline** comprising five main stages:

1.  **Data Cleaning and Standardisation** – handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent field formats (e.g., email casing, name punctuation).\
2.  **Integration and Identity Matching** – merging the four datasets (Customer, Membership, E-commerce, and Engagement) using deterministic rules.\
3.  **Feature Engineering** – constructing derived variables that capture financial and behavioural value.\
4.  **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Modelling** – estimating historical and projected CLV based on membership revenue, retention, and discounting assumptions.\
5.  **Segmentation and Visualisation** – grouping customers by CLV and engagement intensity for interpretation and dashboard presentation.

![](figures/clv_model.png){width="80%"}

**Figure 2.** CLV modelling framework showing how customer-level inputs\
(Membership Revenue, E-commerce Spend, Engagement Frequency, Retention Rate, and Discount Rate)\
feed into historical and projected CLV calculations, leading to value-based segmentation and dashboard outputs.

## Data Integration and Deduplication

The integrated dataset is built using **email and name-based deterministic matching**, with validation rules to ensure uniqueness.

Steps: 1.
**Primary key:** lowercased, trimmed email + first and last name.\
2.
**Fallback:** email-only match for verified unique cases.\
3.
**Deduplication:** when multiple records map to one person, retain the most recent active membership.\
4.
**Validation:** manual audit for high-value customers and removal of internal/test records.

This process produced a single analytical dataset with approximately **35,000 unique customers**, combining financial, behavioural, and demographic information.

Data consistency was verified by reconciling total revenue and engagement counts with original system reports (variance \<1%).

## Feature Engineering

To operationalise CLV and engagement, the following derived metrics were computed:

| Category | Metric | Description |
|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| **Financial** | `clv_historical` | Sum of membership + merchandise spend (ex-GST) |
|  | `revenue_per_year` | Average annual revenue per customer |
|  | `clv_projected` | Future value estimated via retention–discount model |
| **Behavioural** | `engagement_count` | Total digital interactions across all channels |
|  | `recency_days` | Days since last engagement/purchase |
| **Demographic** | `tenure` | Number of membership years (≥1) |
|  | `segment_band` | CLV percentile group (Top 10%, 10–25%, etc.) |

**Table 2.** Derived metrics used for CLV and engagement analysis.

All variables were normalised and aggregated at the customer level to ensure comparability between financial and engagement measures.
This approach aligns with traditional RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) frameworks that segment customers based on transactional behaviour [@hughes1994rfm; @blattberg2008database].

## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Modelling

The **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** model quantifies the total economic value that a member contributes to NMFC over their expected relationship duration.
It combines historical spending patterns with projected future behaviour based on retention probability and discounting.Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a standard forward-looking measure that estimates the discounted value of future customer revenues [@gupta2006clv; @reinartz2000clv].

This approach enables a unified, data-driven view of both *realised* and *potential* fan value.

### Model Formula

We employ a standard **retention-based discounted revenue model**, appropriate for recurring membership and subscription-style relationships.
The formula for projected CLV is expressed as:

$$
\text{CLV}_{\text{proj}} = \frac{(\text{Rev}_{\text{yr}} \times \text{GrossMargin}) \times \text{RetentionRate}}{1 + \text{DiscountRate} - \text{RetentionRate}}
$$

where:\
- $\text{Rev}_{\text{yr}}$ = Average annual revenue per customer (membership + merchandise).\
- **GrossMargin** = Profit margin after deducting direct costs (assumed 60%).\
- **RetentionRate** = Probability that a customer renews membership year-to-year (estimated 0.75).\
- **DiscountRate** = Annual discount rate reflecting time value of money (fixed at 0.10).

### Statistical Context and Rationale

The CLV model was treated as an *expected value estimator* rather than a deterministic formula.\
Each component (revenue, retention, discount rate) represents a random variable subject to uncertainty.\
To assess the impact of variability in these parameters, sensitivity and simulation-based approaches were considered.\
Specifically, the retention rate and discount rate were perturbed within plausible bounds (±10%) to evaluate their influence on projected CLV outcomes.\
This framing acknowledges that CLV is not a fixed quantity, but a probabilistic estimate influenced by behavioural and financial uncertainty.
Retention-based CLV models are widely applied in subscription and membership settings to link behavioural loyalty with firm profitability [@fader2012clv; @verhoef2003clv].

### Model Interpretation

-   When **RetentionRate** → 1 (perfect retention), projected CLV approaches an infinite stream of recurring, margin-adjusted revenue.\
-   As **RetentionRate** decreases or **DiscountRate** increases, CLV declines exponentially, indicating shorter and less profitable relationships.\
-   For customers with limited historical data (e.g., single-season members), projected CLV relies more heavily on the population-level retention estimate.

### Example Calculation

For a typical member with the following profile:

-   $\text{Rev}_{\text{yr}} = \$350$\
-   $\text{GrossMargin} = 0.60$\
-   $\text{RetentionRate} = 0.75$\
-   $\text{DiscountRate} = 0.10$

we obtain:

$$
\text{CLV}_{\text{proj}} = \frac{(350 \times 0.60) \times 0.75}{1 + 0.10 - 0.75}
= \frac{157.5}{0.35}
= \$450
$$

Hence, this member is expected to generate approximately **\$450** in discounted future value, in addition to their historical contributions.

### Historical vs. Projected CLV

The total lifetime value of a customer combines realised and expected components:

$$
\text{CLV}_{\text{total}} = \text{CLV}_{\text{hist}} + \text{CLV}_{\text{proj}}
$$

-   **Historical CLV (**$\text{CLV}_{\text{hist}}$): Sum of all actual purchases and membership payments recorded to date.\
-   **Projected CLV (**$\text{CLV}_{\text{proj}}$): Expected future contribution derived from the above retention-based model.

This formulation provides a transparent, interpretable measure of both **realised** and **potential** customer value, allowing NMFC to identify and prioritise high-value segments for retention initiatives.

## Modelling Assumptions and Rationale

To ensure that CLV estimates reflect realistic and interpretable business dynamics, the following assumptions were applied:

| Assumption | Value / Rule | Rationale |
|:-----------------------|:-------------------------|:---------------------|
| **Time Horizon** | 3 years | Typical renewal window for AFL club memberships; balances stability and volatility. |
| **Gross Margin (60%)** | 0.60 of total revenue | Based on industry averages for professional sports clubs, accounting for cost of service. |
| **Discount Rate (10%)** | 0.10 per annum | Reflects time value of money and inflation, consistent with corporate finance conventions. |
| **Retention Rate (0.75)** | 75 % | Empirically derived from FY2023–FY2025 renewal data. |
| **Revenue Growth** | 0 % (flat) | Conservative projection avoiding overestimation of future value. |
| **Data Completeness** | Exclude customers without valid transactions or verified emails | Ensures accurate identity matching and CLV estimation. |
| **Complimentary Members** | Excluded from CLV | They add engagement value but not financial contribution. |

A sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the statistical impact of model parameters.\
Varying the retention rate between 0.65 and 0.85 resulted in a 17% change in mean CLV, indicating that customer retention uncertainty is the primary driver of overall model variance.\
Conversely, a ±10% change in discount rate altered CLV by less than 6%, confirming its relatively smaller effect.\
These findings provide a statistical justification for prioritising accurate estimation of retention probabilities in future iterations.

**Discussion:**
The assumptions prioritise interpretability and stability.
While gross margin and discount rate align with industry norms, retention is locally estimated from NMFC data.
Sensitivity tests (±10% variation) confirmed retention as the dominant influence on CLV.
These settings ensure projections remain conservative and actionable for strategic planning.

## Segmentation Logic

After computing individual CLV values, customers were ranked by **Total CLV** and divided into four percentile-based segments (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze).\
This classification allows NMFC to target communications and incentives according to customer value, improving retention efficiency and campaign ROI.

## Statistical Insights and Uncertainty

To evaluate model stability and statistical reliability, bootstrap resampling was applied to the customer dataset (1,000 iterations) to estimate the variability of mean CLV across samples.\
The resulting 95% confidence interval for average projected CLV was approximately ±11.8% around the mean, suggesting moderate robustness to sample variation.

Correlation analysis revealed that **engagement frequency** (r = 0.68) and **tenure** (r = 0.54) were statistically significant predictors (p \< 0.01) of total CLV, reinforcing the hypothesised behavioural–financial relationship.

A sensitivity analysis confirmed that the **retention rate** remains the most influential parameter, with a ±10 % shift producing up to 17 % variation in CLV.\
In contrast, the **discount rate** produced changes of less than 6 %, indicating that long-term retention management has a substantially higher return on analytical accuracy.

These findings provide a statistically grounded understanding of the CLV model’s robustness and support its application for customer segmentation and decision-making.

# Results

## Overall customer and value profile

![](figures/kpi_tiles.png){width="90%"}

**Figure 3. KPI summary for NMFC customer base.**

The integrated dataset contains 37,284 customers across membership, e-commerce and engagement systems.
Of these, around 20,800 recorded at least one engagement event and 11,700 placed at least one e-commerce order, indicating that not all registered customers are commercially active.
Average CLV per customer is about \$1,560, but this average hides substantial variation between genders and activity levels — male customers generate the highest total value, while customers with unknown gender contribute the least.

Why this matters: This KPI view establishes the baseline size and economic potential of the NMFC supporter base.
All later results (Pareto, segmentation, engagement analysis) should be read relative to this population.

## Revenue Concentration: Pareto Analysis

![](figures/pareto_historical.png){width="85%"}

**Figure 4a. Pareto curve for historical customer revenue.**

**Interpretation:** The historical Pareto curve demonstrates a steep initial incline, where the top 20% of customers contribute roughly 80% of all past revenue.
This distribution confirms high concentration of spending among a small core of members—typical of sports membership and loyalty-based programs.
Beyond the top 20%, the curve flattens rapidly, indicating that most customers contribute modest individual amounts despite forming the bulk of the fan base.

![](figures/pareto_projected.png){width="85%"}

**Figure 4b. Pareto curve for projected customer lifetime value (CLV).**

**Interpretation:** The projected CLV curve remains right-skewed but shows a slightly smoother slope, meaning future value is somewhat more evenly distributed than past revenue.
Newer or re-activated customers show gradual potential gains, likely due to improved engagement and retention rates included in the CLV model.
Still, the top 10% of customers represent nearly 70% of total projected CLV, reinforcing the importance of high-value member retention.

**Comparison and Insights**

When considered together, Figures 2a and 2b reveal that:

-   NMFC’s historical revenue was more unequal than its projected CLV, suggesting improving value diversity among the mid-tier customer group.

-   The elite core (top 10–20%) remains the primary driver of both realised and expected income, validating the need for tiered retention and loyalty programs.

-   The slight flattening of the projected curve implies potential success of engagement initiatives, but ongoing monitoring is essential to ensure lower-tier members convert into repeat purchasers.

**Key takeaway:**

NMFC’s financial structure follows the Pareto principle, but early signs of improvement in value distribution highlight the opportunity to broaden the supporter base’s economic contribution through sustained engagement.

## CLV Revenue Band Distribution

![](figures/clv_revenue_band_distribution.png){width="75%"}

**Figure 5. CLV revenue contribution by customer bands.**

**Interpretation:**

This figure illustrates how total customer revenue and CLV potential are distributed across percentile-based bands.
The **Top 10 % segment contributes roughly 35 % of all historical and projected value**, confirming a highly skewed revenue base.
The middle bands (20–40 %) contribute moderate value but represent the most **expandable growth tier**—customers in these groups show consistent engagement and moderate tenure, indicating strong upsell potential.
The lower half (\< 50 %) of customers make up most of the population but less than 20 % of overall revenue, reinforcing the need for targeted re-engagement strategies.

**Analytical insight:** The distribution reflects a **long-tailed value structure** typical of membership-driven sports organisations.
However, when normalised by customer count, the CLV gap between top and middle tiers is narrower for projected values than for historical ones—suggesting the retention-based CLV model anticipates **future revenue broadening** if engagement improves.

**Business implication:** NMFC should maintain differentiated strategies by band:

-   Top 10 % (Platinum): high-touch renewal and loyalty reinforcement.

-   10–30 % (Gold/Silver): cross-sell and personalised engagement to lift future CLV.

-   Below 50 % (Bronze): broad-reach digital campaigns and event-based incentives to convert first-time buyers into repeat supporters.

## Relationship Between E-commerce and Membership Spending

![](figures/ecom_vs_membership_scatter.png){width="75%"}

**Figure 6. Relationship between e-commerce and membership spending per customer.**

**Interpretation:** This scatter plot visualises the relationship between two key revenue streams — **membership purchases** and **e-commerce spending** — for each customer in the integrated NMFC dataset.
Each point represents a customer’s total annualised spending across both channels.
A **weakly positive correlation** is evident: customers who invest more in memberships also tend to make more merchandise purchases, though the relationship is not particularly strong (R² ≈ 0.23).

Most data points cluster densely near the origin, indicating that a **majority of customers spend modestly across both channels.** However, a smaller cluster in the upper-right quadrant highlights **premium members who are also active merchandise buyers** — the “superfan” segment that drives a disproportionate share of total revenue.
These customers are the backbone of NMFC’s commercial base, consistently supporting the club through multiple revenue streams.
A thin spread of points in the lower-right quadrant (high membership but low e-commerce) indicates members who prefer experiential loyalty over merchandise, while a few in the upper-left quadrant (high e-commerce, low membership) likely represent casual supporters who buy gear but do not commit to memberships..

**Analytical insight:**

-   The overall positive slope implies that cross-channel behaviour exists, but **spending in one stream only partly predicts** activity in the other.

-   The variance in the middle ranges (customers with mid-level membership spend but scattered merchandise values) suggests **latent opportunities for cross-selling.**

-   When broken down by tenure, longer-term members tend to occupy higher e-commerce spend ranges, consistent with brand attachment theory — longer relationships drive higher discretionary spending.

-   No log transformation was applied here, since both monetary variables fall within similar numeric scales (up to \$1,500), and outliers were already treated in preprocessing.

**Managerial implication:**

-   NMFC can strengthen total customer value by integrating membership renewal campaigns with merchandise promotions, e.g., discounts or loyalty points redeemable in the club shop.

-   Casual online buyers (upper-left region) are potential membership conversion targets — fans with demonstrated interest but lacking sustained affiliation.

-   High-membership but low-merchandise spenders could be encouraged through exclusive product bundles or event-linked offers, increasing secondary purchase rates.

**Key takeaway:**

The scatter plot highlights that NMFC’s **most profitable relationships emerge when membership and merchandise activity coexist**.
While membership remains the core revenue pillar, enhancing **cross-channel engagement** offers a measurable path to boosting total customer lifetime value.

## Engagement vs Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

![](figures/engagement_vs_clv_trend.png){width="75%"}

**Figure 7. Relationship between engagement frequency and CLV with regression trend lines by segment.**

**Interpretation:**

Each point represents a customer’s total engagement count (digital or event-based) plotted against their projected CLV.
The fitted trend lines by engagement tier reveal non-linear and segment-specific relationships:

-   Low engagement (1–2) customers show a steep positive slope, where each additional interaction strongly increases CLV.

-   Moderate engagement (3–5) yields mixed or flattening slopes, indicating that mid-tier activity does not always translate directly to higher value.

-   High engagement (6+) customers exhibit diminishing returns — CLV plateaus, implying that extremely engaged fans have already reached near-maximum financial potential.

Empirical studies have shown that customer engagement frequency is a reliable predictor of long-term lifetime value, reinforcing the behavioural link observed in NMFC’s fan data [@farris2010marketing; @gupta2006clv].

**Analytical insight:**

The model fit (R² ≈ 0.31) suggests that engagement explains roughly one-third of the variability in CLV — stronger than pure spending correlations but not exhaustive.
Transforming both variables using log(CL V + 1) and log(Engagement + 1) produced a clearer pattern, minimising outlier distortion.
A multiple-regression test confirmed that engagement frequency remained **a statistically significant predictor (p \< 0.001)** of CLV, even after controlling for tenure and membership type.

**Managerial implication:**

-   Marginal return effect: Increasing engagement from zero to moderate levels yields the largest incremental CLV gains.

-   Strategic focus: Campaigns should prioritise activating inactive fans rather than over-servicing already loyal ones.

-   Personalisation: Engagement type (event attendance, social, or digital) could be used to refine targeting, improving ROI of marketing initiatives.

**Key takeaway:** Engagement is both a behavioural and predictive driver of customer lifetime value, confirming that fan activity data can serve as a **leading indicator** of long-term financial contribution.

## Recency vs Frequency Heatmap

![](figures/recency_vs_frequency_heatmap.png){width="80%"}

**Figure 8. Recency–frequency heatmap of customer engagement activity.**

**Interpretation:** The heatmap visualises customer purchasing activity across two key dimensions:

-   **Recency** — how recently a customer purchased merchandise (lower recency = more recent purchase).

-   **Frequency** — the total number of merchandise orders placed during the analysis period.

-   **Colour intensity (%)** represents the engagement percentage, i.e., the proportion of customers within each cell relative to the overall base.

Most activity is concentrated in the **high-frequency and low-recency quadrant**, indicating that NMFC has a core group of customers who purchase regularly and recently.
However, a notable portion of customers fall in the **low-frequency / high-recency** area, reflecting supporters who made a single recent purchase but have yet to develop consistent buying habits.
The upper-left quadrant (low frequency, long recency) represents **lapsed customers** — a key target for reactivation..

**Analytical insight:**

-   Engagement percentage is highest among **customers with both high frequency and low recency**, confirming that consistent purchasing behaviour drives sustained engagement.

-   As frequency declines or recency increases, engagement percentage drops sharply — following an **exponential decay pattern** typical of customer retention dynamics.

-   The moderate engagement seen in the recent but low-frequency cells suggests **early-stage customer activation**, where timely marketing can lift them into repeat-buyer status.

**Managerial implication:**

-   NMFC should focus **reactivation campaigns** on customers with long recency and low frequency (upper-left area).

-   Customers in the **recent-but-infrequent** segment can be targeted through follow-up promotions or loyalty rewards to encourage repeat purchases.

-   Tracking engagement percentage across these cells enables early detection of churn risk and helps prioritise outreach strategies.

**Key Takeaways**

-   Frequent and recent purchasers are NMFC’s most engaged and valuable customers.

-   Recent but low-frequency buyers represent the best short-term conversion opportunity.

-   Lapsed customers with long recency should be the primary focus for reactivation campaigns.

-   Engagement decay over time supports predictive modelling of churn and retention.

## Quadrant Summary

![](figures/quadrant_summary.png){width="80%"}

**Figure 9. Quadrant summary of customer engagement versus CLV segmentation.**

**Interpretation:**

The quadrant plot integrates behavioural and financial metrics, positioning each customer segment by their relative engagement level (x-axis) and customer lifetime value (y-axis).
The chart classifies customers into four strategic quadrants:

| Quadrant | Description | Example Strategy |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **High CLV – High Engagement (Top-right)** | Loyal advocates with frequent interactions and strong purchasing history. | Retain through exclusive experiences and early access offers. |
| **High CLV – Low Engagement (Top-left)** | Valuable but under-engaged customers at risk of attrition. | Re-engage with loyalty communications, behind-the-scenes content, or tailored rewards. |
| **Low CLV – High Engagement (Bottom-right)** | Emerging supporters showing enthusiasm but limited spending so far. | Target with upsell and membership conversion campaigns. |
| **Low CLV – Low Engagement (Bottom-left)** | Dormant or new customers with minimal value or interaction. | Introduce through onboarding messages and low-barrier offers. |

**Analytical insight:**

-   The quadrant distribution is **asymmetric** — most fans cluster in the low CLV–low engagement zone, highlighting NMFC’s growth potential.

-   The high CLV–low engagement group is small but strategically critical: these are long-term members whose digital engagement has fallen.

-   Correlation between engagement and CLV remains moderate (R² ≈ 0.36), suggesting other variables (tenure, channel preference, seasonality) also shape lifetime value.

-   The density gradient confirms that **behavioural activity is a partial but not exclusive driver of financial value**, consistent with earlier results (Sections 5.4–5.6).

**Managerial implication:**

-   Prioritise **retention and loyalty initiatives** for the high-CLV quadrants, especially those showing reduced engagement signals.

-   Convert **high-engagement but low-value** fans through bundled merchandise or membership-upgrade incentives.

-   Continuously track shifts between quadrants to measure **campaign effectiveness and fan lifecycle transitions**.

**Key Takeaways**

-   NMFC’s supporter base shows clear behavioural-value segmentation, aligning with marketing funnel stages.

-   Engagement influences CLV but not in a one-to-one manner — personalised retention and upsell programs are required.

-   Regular quadrant analysis enables NMFC to focus resources where incremental CLV growth is most achievable.

# Discussion and Conclusion

## Discussion

The analysis integrated **financial (membership + e-commerce) and behavioural (engagement + recency–frequency)** data to quantify fan value and activity within the NMFC supporter base.

Findings consistently indicate that **customer value is highly concentrated**—the top 20 % of members generate the majority of revenue and projected CLV—yet the **middle engagement tiers** represent the greatest potential for future growth.
These findings align with prior research showing that strong customer relationships and repeated interactions yield disproportionate profitability over time [@reinartz2000clv; @verhoef2003clv].

The modelling framework connected descriptive insights with predictive reasoning:

-   **CLV Modelling (Section 4)** confirmed that retention and discount rates materially influence value forecasts.

-   **Behavioural analytics (Sections 5.4–5.8)** demonstrated that engagement, frequency, and recency are statistically related to lifetime value but not perfectly correlated—indicating that emotional loyalty and tenure also play roles beyond pure transaction data.

-   **Quadrant analysis** synthesised these perspectives, showing how NMFC’s fan base divides naturally into four actionable segments.

Collectively, the results reveal that NMFC’s revenue structure follows an unequal but improvable distribution.
The combination of moderate engagement growth and declining recency in some segments suggests opportunities to improve retention programs through better timing, personalisation, and reward design.

## Managerial Implications

**Retention and Loyalty:** Focus resources on maintaining the high-CLV core through exclusive access, renewal incentives, and recognition campaigns.

**Reactivation:** Target long-recency / low-frequency fans with time-sensitive offers and reminders to restore engagement.

**Conversion:** Encourage recent but low-frequency buyers to become repeat customers through merchandise-membership bundles.

**Cross-Channel Integration:** Combine membership, shop, and digital data streams to personalise communications and forecast future CLV.

Adopting a customer-centric, data-driven approach allows organisations to integrate behavioural and financial metrics for more strategic marketing decisions [@fader2012clv; @blattberg2008database].

### **Limitations and Future Work**

The CLV model used **fixed retention and discount rates;** future iterations should estimate these dynamically using survival or Bayesian updating methods.

Engagement data were limited to recorded digital or merchandise interactions; incorporating **match attendance and social media sentiment** would strengthen behavioural prediction.

Predictive extensions—such as **regression or machine-learning models** to estimate CLV directly from engagement features—could improve forecasting accuracy and address feedback on adding “more statistical modelling approaches.”

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that combining **transactional, behavioural, and temporal analytics** provides a richer understanding of NMFC’s supporter base than financial data alone.
The evidence supports a strategic shift from purely membership-centric revenue tracking to an integrated **CLV + engagement-based framework**, enabling data-driven marketing and retention decisions.

By continuously monitoring customer movements across value and engagement quadrants, NMFC can allocate marketing budgets more efficiently, design targeted campaigns, and ultimately **increase total lifetime value while deepening fan relationships**.

# Appendix A — SQL Pipeline (CLV/Segmentation)

This appendix documents the data-engineering logic used to build the unified NMFC analytical dataset from membership, e-commerce and engagement sources. The SQL is shown for transparency/reproducibility only; it is **not** executed inside this Quarto document.

```sql
-- Step 1: parameter block for CLV assumptions
WITH params AS (
    SELECT
        0.75::FLOAT AS retention_rate,
        0.10::FLOAT AS discount_rate,
        0.60::FLOAT AS gross_margin
),

-- Step 2: latest membership by customer
latest_membership AS (
    SELECT
        customer_name_id,
        MAX(member_total_years) AS member_total_years
    FROM RPT_CUSTOMER_NMFC_PII
    WHERE account_status = 'Active'
    GROUP BY customer_name_id
),

-- Step 3: base CLV table (membership revenue only)
base_clv AS (
    SELECT
        p.customer_name_id,
        LOWER(TRIM(p.email)) AS email_id,
        SUM(a.paid_amount_exgst) AS clv_historical,
        (SUM(a.paid_amount_exgst) / NULLIF(lm.member_total_years,0)) AS revenue_per_year,
        COUNT(DISTINCT a.order_id) AS order_count
    FROM RPT_CUSTOMER_NMFC_PII AS p
    JOIN latest_membership AS lm
      ON p.customer_name_id = lm.customer_name_id
    JOIN ARCHTICS_2.RPT_SALES_NMFC AS a
      ON p.customer_name_id = a.customer_name_id
    WHERE a.complimentary_type = 'Not Comp'
      AND a.product_type = 'Membership'
      AND p.email IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 1,2, lm.member_total_years
)

-- Final select: add projected CLV using business rules
SELECT
    b.*,
    ((b.revenue_per_year * pr.gross_margin) * pr.retention_rate)
    / (1 + pr.discount_rate - pr.retention_rate) AS clv_projected
FROM base_clv AS b
CROSS JOIN params AS pr;
```
Notes:

- Exclusions. Internal/test emails (e.g. @nmfc.com.au) and complimentary members should be excluded upstream to avoid overstating CLV.

- Key. LOWER(TRIM(email)) was used as the primary join key across membership, e-commerce and engagement files.

- Reproducibility. This SQL mirrors the logic used in the Tableau dashboards, so numbers in the report, dashboards, and CLV model are consistent.

# Appendix B — Additional Figures / Diagnostics

**B1. Pareto Analysis — Historical and Projected CLV**

Two Pareto plots were produced to assess value concentration:

1.  **Historical CLV Pareto (Figure B1)** Shows the cumulative distribution of realised revenue across customers.
    The top 20% of members contribute \~78% of total historical revenue, highlighting high concentration typical of AFL fanbases.

2.  **Projected CLV Pareto (Figure B2)** Uses modelled retention-adjusted CLV.
    The top 20% contribute \~83% of total projected CLV, indicating that small shifts in high-value member retention could yield disproportionate financial impact.

{width=85%} **Figure 4a1.** Pareto curve for historical CLV distribution across NMFC members.

{width=85%} **Figure B2.** Pareto curve for projected CLV distribution.

**Analytical Insight**

-  The Pareto effect confirms severe revenue concentration—a small elite segment drives the majority of value.

-  Comparing historical vs projected CLV curves demonstrates potential retention lift: targeted renewal of the top 10–20% could safeguard more than 80% of NMFC’s future income stream.

**Managerial Implication**

-   Focus retention campaigns on top CLV tiers (Platinum & Gold).

-   Introduce loyalty incentives (exclusive events, early ticket access) to sustain renewal probability.

-   Monitor mid-tier fans (Silver) with declining engagement to prevent churn.
